# Summarizer Agent

Summarizer Agent is an AI-powered tool designed to efficiently process and summarize documents. It automates the scanning of files from a designated folder, validates their format, and utlizes Groq API to generate concise, accurate summaries. The summaries are saved in a CSV file, streamlining document analysis for quicker insights.

## Features

- Automated File Processing: Automatically scans and processes files from a specified folder.
- File Validation: Ensures only valid formats are summarized.
- AI-Powered Summarization: Uses Groqâ€™s advanced AI to deliver precise summaries.
- Bulk Processing: Simultaneously handles multiple files.
- Customizable Folder Path: Easily configure the folder path for input files.
- Error Handling: Provides feedback on any invalid or unsupported files.
- Efficient and Scalable: Optimized for processing large documents and multiple files efficiently.
